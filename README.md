# Introduction to Robotics (2022 - 2023)


Introduction to Robotics laboratory project, taken in the 3rd year at the **Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science**, University of Bucharest. 

<h2> 🏎️ Line follower </h2>

### 📜 Task Requirements

#### Components
- chassis
- Arduino Uno Board
- 2 DC motors
- 2 wheels
- L293D driver
- button
- breadboard
- 2 LEDs
- resistors
- wires per logic
- QTR sensor
- zip ties
- nuts and bolts

#### Description
This is a robot that follows a line using QTR sensors and PID.
It self calibrates and we save the calibration in EEPROM so we do not have to redo the calibration every single time. 
The PID algorithm processes the values from multiple ranges registered by the sensors and passes the new numbers to the motors. 
Our best time during the evaluation was 19.53 seconds.
